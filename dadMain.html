      <h3>About me as a person</h3>

      <p>
        My name is Paul Taylor. I live in a small town called Banbury in United
        Kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>I work as a refuge collector for our town's county council.</p>
      <p>
        I have a lovely family, consisting of 2 children, one biological and one
        step and a lovely Wife
      </p>
      <p>
        I first got into 3D printing when I found an almost mint condition
        printer in a bin when I was on one of my rounds
      </p>
      <p>
        When I bought it home I fixed it by replacing a motor in it and it was
        working amazingly, although I of course had to adjust settings in it a
        lot throughtout the process
      </p>
      <p>
        This website is going to be about my adventures with 3D printing and
        what it has done for me, aswell as some timelapses I have recorded!
      </p>
      <p>I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>
